# boids
A code sample for a simple "boids" simulator

## Background

Boids are a simple example of emergent phenomenon. They were developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986 to simulate the flocking behavior of birds. The classical boid follows three rules:  
1. Try not hit the other boids (Separation)
2. Try to match other boids direction (Alignment)
3. Try to stay with the flock (Cohesion)  

From these few rules, you get emergent flocking phenomenon.

## Compilation
run `make all` to create the executable `bin/boids`  
run `make clean` to clean out these exectables
